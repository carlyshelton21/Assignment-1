      <h1>From childhood’s hour I have not been
          As others were—I have not seen
          As others saw—I could not bring
          My passions from a common spring—
          </h1>
</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>From the same source I have not taken
            My sorrow—I could not awaken
            My heart to joy at the same tone—
            And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—
             </h2>
          <h3>Then—in my childhood—in the dawn
Of a most stormy life—was drawn
From ev’ry depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still—
</h3>
            <h4>From the torrent, or the fountain—
From the red cliff of the mountain—
From the sun that ’round me roll’d
In its autumn tint of gold—
</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
              <h5>From the lightning in the sky
As it pass’d me flying by—
From the thunder, and the storm—
And the cloud that took the form
</h5>
  </li>
         </ul>

                <h6>(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view—</h6>

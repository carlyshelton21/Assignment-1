        <span>
        <ol><li>From childhood’s hour I have not been</li></ol>
      <ol>As others were—I have not seen</ol>
      <ol>As others saw—I could not bring</ol>
      <ol>My passions from a common spring—</ol>
      <ol>From the same source I have not taken</ol>
      </span>
      </h1>
      <h6>My sorrow—I could not awaken
      My heart to joy at the same tone—
      And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—
      Then—in my childhood—in the dawn
      Of a most stormy life—was drawn</h6>
      <h2>
        <ol><li>From ev’ry depth of good and ill</li></ol>
      <ol>The mystery which binds me still—</ol>
      <ol>From the torrent, or the fountain—</ol>
      <ol>From the red cliff of the mountain—</ol>
      <ol>From the sun that ’round me roll’</ol>
    </h2>
      <h5>In its autumn tint of gold—
      From the lightning in the sky
      As it pass’d me flying by—
      From the thunder, and the storm—</h5>
      <h3>And the cloud that took the form
      (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
      Of a demon in my view—</h3>
    </ul>
